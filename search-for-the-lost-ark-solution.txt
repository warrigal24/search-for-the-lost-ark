Search for the Lost Ark

For Z-code interpreters

Solution by Garry Francis
----------------------------------------
This is a minimal solution. You'll need to EXAMINE lots of things for this solution to make sense. Some optional (but significant) commands are shown in parentheses. These can be omitted once you know what to do.

Your goal is to find the Ark of the Covenant and return it to the altar in your local church. The Ark has been hidden in a chest, so you firstly have to find the chest. When you find it, you'll see that it is locked with a five-digit combination lock, so you'll have to find the five digits used for the combination and work out the sequence to enter the digits. The five digits of the combination are scattered throughout the game as references to Biblical passages. The references are randomly allocated at the start of the game. The Biblical passages provide the numbers you need. You can look these up in the Bible that you find in the game. (If you have a King James version of the Bible, you can also look them up in a real Bible.) There are 7000 possible combinations, so you will have to find and read all the Bible references to work out the combination before you can unlock the chest.
